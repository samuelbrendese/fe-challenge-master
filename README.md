# Front End Developer Challenge

![Desktop Preview](./design/desktop.png)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for taking the time to check out this code challenge.

**To complete this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

## The Challenge

Your goal is to create a landing page that looks as close as possible to the designs included in the design folder.

**Please do not use any third-party libraries, frameworks, or components for this challenge. All markup and code should be written from scratch in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

### General Notes

- Links don't need to point anywhere (`#` works fine)
- The form doesn't need to lead anywhere but it does need to be styled
- Menu(s) should be implemented but it's up to you how you'd like them to function
- The mobile layout is only available in `.png` format - it is not included in the Sketch or Figma files
- If you're unable to open the `.sketch` or `.fig` file, please refer to the `.pdf` or `.png` files~ instead
- If you're unsure about something, please use your best judgment to determine a solution

### High Priority Items

Below are things you should pay particular attention to when completing this challenge.

- Responsive design and development
- Page performance (e.g. loading speed)
- Interactive element states (e.g. hover, focus, etc.)

### Low Priority Items

Below are things you should not worry about when completing this challenge.

- Exactly matching the fonts and icons
- Exactly matching the text content from the design (placeholder text is fine)

### Extra Credit

- If you notice a flaw or potential improvement in the page design, point it out and explain it at the bottom of this file.

## Getting Started

1. Set up this project with version control (e.g. Git)
2. Read this `README.md` file and familiarize yourself with the project structure
3. Start coding!

## Submitting Your Solution

1. Upload your completed work to a public GitHub repository
2. Share the link to this repository with your interviewer

## Flaws/Improvements

1. Under the assumption that the dropdown menu points to the same links as the nav links on the top center of the page,
it would seem slightly redundant to have 2 menus pointing to the same links. Perhaps the dropdown menu could remain and the 
top middle section of the site could be used to hold different/higher priority content.

2. I replicated the page as much as possible, although it would be more secure and easier on a backend team if the name 
parameters for the sign up form were split into first and last name. Adding an optional phone number input parameter would be
a good idea as well.

3. For added security, having a required radio button to ensure the users consents to the terms of service would be another possibility for the sign up form.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€

## Sam's Comments

1. I experienced some technical issues with the provided roboto fonts so I found similar ones to match (low priority).

2. All code explanations are included in the HTML and CSS files for sake of organization.

3. Thank you!
